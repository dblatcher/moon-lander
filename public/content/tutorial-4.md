### Refueling
You won't always have enough fuel to reach your goal, but there may be refuel pads on the way. To refuel, land on the red pad and wait. The pad only have a limited amount of fuel - it won't always be enough to fill your tanks.

The more thrust you apply, the faster you drain your fuel reserves. Always keep an eye on the fuel gage.
