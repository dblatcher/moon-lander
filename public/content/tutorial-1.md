### About this game
The object of the game is to pilot your landing craft safely on to the green landing pad. Use WASD or the arrow keys to control the craft:
- *UP / W*    : Increase thrust
- *DOWN / S*  : Decrease thrust
- *LEFT / A*  : Turn clockwise
- *RIGHT / D* : Turn anti-clockwise
- *P* : Pause game

The landing pad is right below you. Increase your thrust to about 50% to slow your descent. The speed indicator will flash if you are going too fast.

When you are on the landing pad, decrease the thrust to zero.
