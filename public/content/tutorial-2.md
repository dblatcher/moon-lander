### Finding your way
The scanner marks your craft in red and the landing pad in green. It also shows what obstacles you'll need to navigate round to reach the pad.

Turn up the thrust to take off and steer towards the landing pad. Adjust your thrust and heading as you go to compensate for gravity. When you reach the landing pad, carefully ease off on the thrust to lower the craft down safely. Cut the thrust to zero when on the pad to finish.
