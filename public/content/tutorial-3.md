### Finding your way
As a pilot, you'll have to control your craft in many different environments. On the previous levels, you were flying in a dense atmosphere. The air resistance was slowing down your craft, making it a little easier to control. This time you'll be flying in a vacuum on a planet with lower gravity.

Fly to the landing pad like last time - but notice how the difference in the environment and how it effects your flying.
