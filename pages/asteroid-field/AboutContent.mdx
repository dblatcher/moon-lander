## Asteroid Field

*Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. The current known asteroid count is: 1,113,527.*

*Most of this ancient space rubble can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Vesta – the largest at about 329 miles (530 kilometers) in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.*

Since 1,113,527 is clearly far too many, in this game you'll be blowing a few up, while trying to avoid getting your ship smashed to bits by a rocky, airless remnant.
