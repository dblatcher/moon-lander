### Once in a blue moon
A proper space mission this time... Gravity is not *always* down.

You'll be landing on a small moon. Fly round to the far side and land on the pad.

This is *very* important, pilot - where G is the graviational constant and r is the distance between two bodies, the gravitational force equals G times the product of their masses over r squared. What does that mean? It means that moon will pull you in harder, the closer you get to it. So keep those retros firing and ease yourself down as slowly as you can.
