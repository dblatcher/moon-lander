### Mountains of Proxima B
A nice, simple one for you, rookie. You're delivering supplies to the mining facility on Proxima B.

You'll be dropped more or less over the landing zone, so be ready. Just nudge yourself over it and watch your rate of descent. The atmosphere is thin so you'll drop like a stone.

But try not to burn ALL your fuel, okay? It's expensive stuff. Remember, you get a bonus for what you have left over.
