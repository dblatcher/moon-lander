### Moon Base
Bit of taxi job for you...

Lift off from the tower and fly east to the landing pad on the other side of the base. Keep an eye on the scanner so you know when you're about to fly into a building - you want to fly OVER them.

There is no atmosphere on this moon, so nothing will slow your lateral movement - that's going side to side to you. Get enought lift to counter the gravity, but don't push too hard going east - you will need to reverse when you overshoot the landing pad.
